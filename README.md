## A Little History

I have worked as an Industrial Automation programmer/Engineer for over 40 years.  When I wasn't programming PLC's or industrial robots, I would write programs in C++, Python, and MicroPython for Arduinos and RaspBerry Pi's.

## Current Projects

- I am working on building a skeleton frame for a full stack web development project that provides responsiveness and interactivity.
  - To do that, I am going through Codecademy's "Full Stack Web Engineer" course, and applying what I learn.
  - You can visit the [_Template_ repository here](https://github.com/mnkth01a/templates.git) to watch the progress.
 
- _Next project here!_
